# Neighborhood Council Website Community Survey 

Most NCs do not have access or resources to hire technical experts necessary to create a citywide survey so that they can use the data to create inclusive websites targeted towards the needs of their specific communities. Working with EmpowerLA and NCs, Hack for LA is providing the workforce and expertise to design and implement a survey that will give NCs a tool to understand the overall needs of their community -- beyond the people already involved in NCs.
